[Github Essentials Guide](http://joeyklee.github.io/friendly-github-intro/guides/github-essentials/)

* You will have an hour to play around in the GitHubverse - we will be around to help clarify and guide you through any questions you might have. 
* To get a feeling for the workflow shown in the prior presentations, try to:
	* Create a repo from scratch
	* Make a README using markdown documenting what your project is about, who is involved, why it is interesting, how to get the project setup (e.g. what version of R, what packages are you using, links to references, and add a friendly gif, etc.) 
	* Create some issues that need to be completed - add labels to them.
	* Create a few commits
	* Create a branch to experiment new features on:
		* make a pull request to merge those changes into your "master" branch
	* Revert a commit
	* Celebrate! 

**12:00 - 12:30: Lunch**

* Pizza and drinks will be served (there will be some veg/gluten free options in case there are food allergies) - Thanks UBC Library (again)!
